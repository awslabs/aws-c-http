--- README FOR unittests.* files ---

These files are used in unit tests that create TLS connections between a
localhost server and client. We use a single self-signed certificate which
serves as both the server's certificate and the client's root CA.

unittests.key: private key
unittests.crt: self-signed certificate
unittests.conf: configuration for generating unittests.crt
unittests.p12: pkcs#12 file bundling the certificate and private key. Password is "1234"

Apple won't trust any certificate whose lifetime is over 825 days.
Once it expires unit tests will start failing and it will need to be updated like so:

$ openssl req -x509 -new -key unittests.key -config unittests.conf -out unittests.crt -days 824
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -out unittests.p12 -inkey unittests.key -in unittests.crt -password pass:1234
