# threads created here are not explicitly joined but they are part of a ref-count mechanism that
# decrements (with a possible signal of a shutdown callback based on state and count) on thread
# exit function.  For now, there is no reasonable way to integrate thread join into the host resolver
# logic, and so this is a false positive.
